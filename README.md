# Assignment-2-Python
# 1. Check whether a number is even or odd using if-else in Python

This program:

1. Takes a number as input from the user.
2. Divides the number by 2 using the modulus operator (%).
3. If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
4. Otherwise, the number is odd.

What it does:

It checks the nature of a number and tells whether it is even or odd based on divisibility by 2.

# Sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop

This program:

1. Starts with a sum value of 0.
2. Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
3. Adds each number to the sum one by one.
4. Finally prints the total sum.

What it does:

It automatically calculates the total of all numbers from 1 to 50 instead of adding them manually.
